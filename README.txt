C++ Course: Concepts and Challenges Welcome to the C++ Course repository! This repository is designed to help you understand and master the key concepts of C++ programming through a series of workspaces, each containing targeted exercises and challenges.

TOPICS COVERED

Operator Overloading:

Operator overloading allows you to redefine the functionality of operators (such as +, -, *, etc.) for user-defined types. By overloading operators, you can specify how operators behave with objects of your classes, making them more intuitive and easy to use.

Objects:

Objects are instances of classes. They encapsulate data and functions that operate on the data. Understanding objects is crucial for grasping how to structure and manipulate complex data in C++.

Inheritance:

Inheritance enables a new class (derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of an existing class (base class). This allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, promoting modular and organized code.

Functions:

Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. In C++, functions defined within a class are known as methods and can manipulate the data contained within objects of the class.

Pointers:

Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They are powerful tools in C++ that enable dynamic memory management, efficient array handling, and the creation of complex data structures like linked lists and trees.

Controlling Program Flow:

Controlling program flow involves the use of control structures such as if statements, loops (for, while, do-while), and switch statements. These structures allow you to dictate the order in which statements are executed based on certain conditions.

Characters and Strings:

Characters and strings are used to handle text in C++. While characters represent single letters, digits, or symbols, strings are sequences of characters. Understanding how to manipulate characters and strings is fundamental for text processing and user input handling.

Expressions and Statements:

Expressions are combinations of variables, operators, and values that produce a result. Statements are complete instructions that tell the program to perform an action. Mastering expressions and statements is essential for writing functional and logical code.

Arrays and Vectors:

Arrays and vectors are used to store collections of data. Arrays have a fixed size, while vectors can dynamically resize. Learning to use arrays and vectors effectively will enable you to handle multiple data items efficiently.

Variables:

Variables are used to store data that can be manipulated and retrieved throughout the program. They have specific data types that define the kind of data they can hold. Understanding variables is the first step towards writing any C++ program.
